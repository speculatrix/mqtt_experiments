Here's a few test programs for learning about how mqtt works.

A listener subscribes to a specific server and queue, and there are two
publisher programs, one of which also demonstrates the use of multithreading
to listen to the keyboard input and send key strokes as mqtt messages
(might be handy for my Pi Radio app, to give it a remote control feature).
